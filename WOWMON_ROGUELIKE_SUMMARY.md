## Key Transformations

### Game Structure

**BEFORE (Linear Adventure):**
```
Town → Route → Trainer → Route → Gym → Badge → Next Town
```

**AFTER (Roguelike Loop):**
```
Meta Hub → Run Setup → Floor Generation → Encounters → Boss → Escape Decision
    ↓                                                              ↓
    ← Death/Victory → Shard Conversion → Unlock Progress ← Continue
```

### Persistence Model

**BEFORE:**
- Single persistent save file
- All progress permanent
- No run concept

**AFTER:**
- Dual save system:
  - **Meta Progress** (permanent): Soul shards, unlocks, achievements
  - **Active Run** (temporary): Team, items, relics, floor progress
- Run resets on death
- Meta-progression continues forever

### Reward Loop

**BEFORE:**
- Linear badges (8 total)
- Fixed creature roster
- One-time trainer rewards

**AFTER:**
- Infinite replayability
- 25+ unlockable starters
- 80+ unlockable relics
- 30+ permanent upgrades
- 100+ achievements
- Exponential power scaling

---

## Core Roguelike Pillars

### 1. Procedural Generation
- Every floor is unique (seeded random)
- 8-15 rooms per floor
- Room types: Combat, Elite, Treasure, Rest, Shop, Event, Boss
- Floor modifiers add variety
- Same seed = same dungeon (enables daily challenges)

### 2. Permadeath
- All creatures faint = run ends
- Lose: Team, items, relics, gold
- Keep: Soul shards (converted from gold), unlocks, stats
- Death feels fair and educational

### 3. Meta-Progression
- **Soul Shards** = permanent currency
- Unlock new starter creatures (25 total)
- Unlock relics (80+ total)
- Buy permanent stat boosts
- Never lose long-term progress

### 4. Meaningful Choices
- Which path through floor?
- Fight or flee?
- Escape with rewards or risk for more?
- Which blessing/relic/upgrade?
- Resource management (HP, items, gold)

### 5. Build Variety
- 6+ viable archetypes (glass cannon, tank, speed, type specialist, etc.)
- Synergies between creatures, types, relics
- Random modifiers each run
- Hundreds of possible combinations

### 6. Risk/Reward
- Banking system (escape after bosses)
- Events with beneficial/harmful choices
- Elite enemies for better loot
- Deeper floors = exponentially better rewards

---

## Target Metrics

### Engagement
- **"One more run" rate:** >70% (players restart immediately after death)
- **Average session:** 30-60 minutes
- **Retention:** >50% return next day
- **Long-term:** 100-200 hours to unlock everything

### Difficulty Curve
- **Floor 10:** 80% of players reach within 5 runs
- **Floor 25:** 40% of players reach eventually
- **Floor 50:** 5-10% completion rate
- **Skill matters:** Top 10% reach Floor 50 in <20 runs

### Economy Balance
- **First unlock:** 3-5 runs
- **Mid-tier unlock:** 10-15 runs
- **Legendary unlock:** 30-50 runs
- **Grind prevention:** Skill > time invested

- 3 room types (Combat, Treasure, Boss)
- Basic soul shard system
- 2 unlockable creatures
- 5 basic relics
- Simple meta hub UI
- Death/summary screens

### MVP Excludes

## Technical Requirements

### Preserved Code (~60%)
- ✅ Battle system (turn-based combat)
- ✅ Creature stats and types
- ✅ Move system
- ✅ Evolution mechanics
- ✅ Type effectiveness
- ✅ Audio engine
- ✅ Visual rendering

### New Code (~40%)
- 🆕 Procedural generation
- 🆕 Room-based navigation
- 🆕 Meta-progression system
- 🆕 Dual save manager
- 🆕 Death/reward handlers
- 🆕 New UI screens
- 🆕 Relic effect system

### File Size
- Current: ~70kb (HTML + CSS + JS inline)
- Estimated after conversion: ~120-150kb
- Still under 200kb (excellent for local-first)

---

## Success Criteria

The roguelike redesign succeeds if:

1. ✅ Players immediately restart after death ("one more run")
2. ✅ Multiple viable strategies exist (not one meta build)
3. ✅ Each run feels meaningfully different
4. ✅ Meta-progression feels rewarding (not grindy)
5. ✅ Reaching Floor 10 feels achievable for new players
6. ✅ Reaching Floor 50 feels epic for skilled players
7. ✅ Skill matters more than grind time
8. ✅ Game works 100% offline (local-first principle)
9. ✅ Mobile-friendly (touch controls work perfectly)
10. ✅ File size stays reasonable (<200kb self-contained)

---

## Why This Works

### Addresses Original Game Limitations
- **Linear progression → Infinite replayability:** Procedural generation ensures no two runs are identical
- **One-time content → Endless content:** Same 25 creatures become 1000s of possible team combinations
- **Fixed difficulty → Scalable challenge:** Floor 1-50 provides difficulty for all skill levels
- **No long-term goals → Rich meta-game:** Unlocks, upgrades, achievements, prestige

### Roguelike Genre Strengths
- **High replayability:** Core to the genre, proven engagement
- **"One more run" psychology:** Variable rewards, near-misses, incremental progress
- **Skill expression:** Good players progress faster, not just time invested
- **Build variety:** Discovering synergies and broken combos is fun
- **Risk/reward decisions:** Every choice matters, creates tension

### Local-First Friendly
- **No server needed:** All procedural generation client-side
- **No multiplayer sync:** Asynchronous daily challenges only
- **Works offline:** Perfect for local-first philosophy
- **Export/import saves:** JSON-based, portable across devices
- **No build process:** Still single self-contained HTML file

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Too Grindy
**Mitigation:**
- Exponential shard scaling (later floors = way more shards)
- Skill-based bonuses (perfect battles, speed runs)
- Achievement one-time bonuses
- Extensive playtesting with casual players

### Risk 2: Repetitive Gameplay
**Mitigation:**
- 80+ relics creating build variety
- Floor modifiers mixing up rules
- Event rooms with unique choices
- Multiple viable strategies
- Random run modifiers

### Risk 3: Too Difficult
**Mitigation:**
- Adaptive difficulty (losing streaks get easier)
- Meta-upgrades make future runs easier
- Clear difficulty curve (Floor 1-10 tutorial)
- Death as learning (not punishment)
- Escape system (bank progress before dying)

### Risk 4: Loss of Story/Character
**Mitigation:**
- Creature descriptions and lore remain
- Event rooms can tell environmental stories
- Achievement flavor text
- Boss characters with personalities
- Prestige unlocks narrative content

## Next Steps

### For Immediate Implementation:
1. Read **WOWMON_ROGUELIKE_REDESIGN.md** for full design vision
2. Study **WOWMON_ROGUELIKE_IMPLEMENTATION.md** for code patterns
3. Reference **WOWMON_ROGUELIKE_QUICKSTART.md** for priorities
4. Use **WOWMON_ROGUELIKE_UI_MOCKUPS.md** for screen layouts

### Recommended Approach:
1. Start with **MVP scope** (4-5 weeks)
2. Playtest with 5-10 users
3. Iterate based on feedback
4. Add advanced features incrementally
5. Balance economy based on metrics
6. Release full version after 8-12 weeks

### Testing Priority:
- Floor generation (does it create fun layouts?)
- Death → shard conversion (feels rewarding?)
- First unlock (achievable in 3-5 runs?)
- Floor 10 (fair difficulty spike?)
- "One more run" feeling (do players restart?)

## Conclusion

This roguelike redesign transforms WoWMon from a finite linear adventure into an infinite replayability machine while preserving what makes the original fun:

- ✅ **Keeps:** Pokemon-style battles, creatures, evolutions, types
- ✅ **Adds:** Procedural dungeons, permadeath, meta-progression, endless variety
- ✅ **Result:** Addictive "one more run" loop with 100+ hours of content

The transformation leverages proven roguelike design patterns (Slay the Spire, Hades, Dead Cells) while maintaining the local-first, self-contained HTML file architecture.

**Estimated development:** 8-12 weeks full-time, 4-5 weeks for MVP

**Estimated playtime:** 100-200 hours to unlock everything, infinite for mastery

**Target audience:** Roguelike fans + Pokemon fans + casual mobile gamers
