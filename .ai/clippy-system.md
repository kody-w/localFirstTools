# Clippy: Context-Aware AI Assistant System

Clippy is the user-facing interface for the AI intelligence briefing system. It reads the daily briefing file and uses it as a persistent memory layer to provide contextually intelligent guidance.

## Architecture Overview

## How Clippy Works

### 1. Briefing as Memory

Clippy loads `.ai/windows95-agent-state.json` on initialization and uses it as its persistent memory:

```javascript
// Clippy's memory structure
{
  briefingContext: {
    timeGapContext: {
      gapCategory: "long_absence",
      daysSinceLastBriefing: 1836,
      gapDescription: "5 years"
    },
    todaysAgenda: {
      keyPriorities: [...],
      aiGuidance: "...",
      recommendedPrograms: [...]
    },
    insights: {
      yesterdayStats: {...},
      suggestions: [...],
      achievements: [...]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Personality Calibration

Clippy's personality changes based on time gap:

| Time Gap | Personality | Tone | Frequency | Example Greeting |
|----------|-------------|------|-----------|------------------|
| Same day | Casual encouraging | Energetic | Medium | "Hey! You're back already. Let's keep going!" |
| Normal daily | Energetic supportive | Professional | Medium | "Good morning! Ready to tackle today's priorities?" |
| Weekend return | Refreshed welcoming | Positive | Medium | "Welcome back after the weekend! Feeling refreshed?" |
| Weekly return | Gentle reorienting | Patient | Low | "It's been a week! Let me help you get back up to speed." |
| Monthly return | Patient guiding | Supportive | Low | "Welcome back! It's been a while. Want a quick tour?" |
| Long absence | Extremely gentle | No pressure | Very low | "Wow, it's been ages! No pressure today - I'm here if you need me." |

### 3. Contextual Tips

Clippy generates tips based on the briefing context:

**For Long Absence (5 years):**
- "After 5 years, I recommend spending 10-15 minutes just exploring"
- "Your briefing suggests: 'Treat this as Day 1 of a fresh journey'"
- "No need to be productive today. Just showing up is an achievement!"

**For Same Day (3 hours ago):**
- "You've completed 2 tasks already today. Keep going!"
- "Your most productive time today has been around this hour"
- "You have 3 priorities left for today"

**For Normal Daily:**
- "Top priority: 'Complete project proposal by 11 AM'"
- "Yesterday you completed 7 tasks - great momentum!"
- "Recommended programs for today: Notepad, Paint"

### 4. Proactive Intelligence

Clippy can provide tips at strategic moments:

```javascript
// Example: User opens Notepad
clippy.maybeShowTip({
  action: 'opened_notepad',
  timestamp: Date.now()
});

// Clippy checks briefing and might say:
"I see you opened Notepad. Your briefing says to use it for task planning!"
```

```javascript
// Example: User hasn't interacted for 5 minutes
clippy.maybeShowTip({
  action: 'idle',
  duration: 300000
});

// Clippy checks briefing and might say:
"Need help getting started? Your top priority is: 'Review and organize open projects'"
```

## User Interactions

### Clicking Clippy Icon (Taskbar)

1. User clicks 📎 icon in bottom-right of taskbar
2. Clippy appears with a contextual tip from briefing
3. User can choose:
   - "👍 Thanks!" - Dismisses Clippy
   - "💡 Another tip" - Shows another context-aware tip

### Initial Greeting (On Login)

After 3 seconds of page load, Clippy automatically appears with:

**Long Absence Example:**
```
"Wow, it's been ages! No pressure today - I'm here if you need me.

💡 I see you've been away for 5 years since last briefing.
Your daily briefing has been adjusted to be gentle and
welcoming. No pressure today!"

[📋 Show Daily Briefing] [✨ Give me a tip] [👋 Maybe later]
```

**Normal Day Example:**
```
"Good morning! Ready to tackle today's priorities?

💡 Today's top priority: Complete project proposal by 11 AM"

[📋 Show Daily Briefing] [✨ Give me a tip] [👋 Maybe later]
```

## Technical Implementation

### Memory Loading

```javascript
async loadBriefingContext() {
    const response = await fetch('.ai/windows95-agent-state.json', {
        cache: 'no-cache'
    });
    this.briefingContext = await response.json();
    this.calibratePersonality();
    this.showInitialGreeting();
}
```

### Personality Calibration

```javascript
calibratePersonality() {
    const gap = this.briefingContext.timeGapContext.gapCategory;

    this.personalities = {
        'long_absence': {
            tone: 'extremely_gentle',
            helpfulness: 'low',
            frequency: 'very_low',
            greeting: "Wow, it's been ages!..."
        },
        // ... other personalities
    };

    this.currentPersonality = this.personalities[gap];
}
```

### Tip Generation

```javascript
giveContextualTip() {
    const timeGap = this.briefingContext.timeGapContext;
    const agenda = this.briefingContext.todaysAgenda;
    const insights = this.briefingContext.insights;

    let tips = [];

    // Generate tips based on time gap
    if (timeGap.gapCategory === 'long_absence') {
        tips.push(
            `After ${timeGap.gapDescription}, just explore and get comfortable.`,
            `Your briefing suggests: "${agenda.aiGuidance}"`,
            `Showing up after ${timeGap.gapDescription} is an achievement!`
        );
    }

    // Pick random tip and show
    const tip = tips[Math.floor(Math.random() * tips.length)];
    this.show(tip, actions);
}
```
