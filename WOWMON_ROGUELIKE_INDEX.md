## ❓ Quick FAQ

**Q: How much of the original game is preserved?**
A: ~60% of code (battle system, creatures, moves) stays. Replace exploration with procedural dungeons.

**Q: Will it still be a single HTML file?**
A: YES! Still self-contained, no build process, works offline. Just larger (~150kb).

**Q: How long to implement?**
A: MVP in 4-5 weeks, full version in 8-12 weeks.

**Q: Does this break the local-first philosophy?**
A: NO! Everything still works offline. Procedural generation is client-side. Optional cloud sync for cross-device only.

**Q: Can players transfer saves from old version?**
A: No direct transfer, but could import creatures as unlocked starters in meta hub.

**Q: What about mobile?**
A: Perfect for mobile! Touch controls, 15min-4hr sessions, works offline.

**Q: Is permadeath too harsh?**
A: Death resets run but keeps meta-progress (shards, unlocks). Fair and educational, not punishing.

**Q: How does daily challenge work without server?**
A: Date-based seed (YYYYMMDD). Same day = same dungeon worldwide. Leaderboards optional (localStorage).
