NEXT STEPS
=================================================================

1. Review design documents
2. Choose implementation phase (recommend P0 first)
3. Copy code snippets into wowMon.html
4. Test IV/EV system
5. Add breeding system
6. Build Battle Tower
7. Create achievement tracking
8. Iterate and polish

=================================================================
NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS
=================================================================

INTEGRATION APPROACH:
- Start with Phase 1 (core systems)
- Each phase is independent and testable
- Code snippets are ready to copy-paste
- Backward compatible with existing saves

TESTING CHECKLIST:
□ IVs generate correctly (0-31)
□ EVs awarded after battle (respect caps)
□ Stats recalculate with IV/EV/Nature
□ Breeding creates eggs
□ IV Judge displays correctly
□ Battle Tower generates opponents
□ Achievements unlock properly
□ Shiny odds work as expected

DIFFICULTY BALANCE:
- Start systems unlocked early (tutorial)
- Battle Tower at 8 badges (late-game)
- IV Judge at Floor 50 (mid-endgame)
- Shiny Charm at Pokedex completion
- Prestige at Champion + Pokedex

=================================================================
CONCLUSION
=================================================================

This endgame design transforms WoWMon into a deep, competitive
experience with 200+ hours of content. The combination of:

• IV/EV competitive systems
• Breeding mechanics
• Battle facilities
• Shiny hunting
• 80+ achievements
• Meta-progression

...creates a self-sustaining gameplay loop that rivals mainline
Pokemon games in depth and replayability.

All systems are designed, documented, and ready for implementation.
Code snippets are provided for rapid integration.

Ready to build the ultimate endgame!
