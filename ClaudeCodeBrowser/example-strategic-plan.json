  "valueProps": "1) AI-powered status updates that write themselves from Git commits, Slack messages, and calendar events 2) Smart deadline prediction using historical velocity data 3) Automated stakeholder reporting with natural language summaries 4) Single source of truth replacing 5+ disconnected tools",
  "channels": "Product-led growth through free tier, content marketing targeting engineering leaders, strategic partnerships with dev tool companies, and targeted LinkedIn outreach to VPs of Engineering at growth-stage companies.",
  "revenue": "Tiered SaaS subscription: Starter ($29/user/month for teams under 10), Professional ($49/user/month with advanced AI features), Enterprise (custom pricing with SSO, dedicated support, and on-premise options). Additional revenue from implementation services and custom integrations.",

    "competitor": "If a major competitor enters the market, we will: 1) Double down on our unique AI differentiation and release advanced features 2 months ahead of schedule, 2) Lock in existing customers with multi-year contracts offering 25% discount, 3) Pivot to vertical specialization (focus exclusively on software development teams vs. general PM), 4) Explore exclusive partnership with major developer tools platform (GitHub, GitLab, Atlassian) for embedded distribution, 5) Launch aggressive comparison marketing campaign highlighting our technical superiority.",
    "customer": "If we lose our primary customer segment, we will: 1) Rapidly pivot to adjacent segment (product teams vs. engineering teams) by adjusting messaging and feature prioritization, 2) Conduct 50 customer interviews within 30 days to identify next best segment, 3) Develop industry-specific versions for high-potential verticals (fintech, healthtech, edtech), 4) Consider acqui-hire exit to preserve team and technology, 5) Explore horizontal expansion into general team collaboration vs. project management only."

Our key focus areas are: 1) Hitting $100k MRR through improved conversion and expansion, 2) Reducing churn below 3% through better onboarding, 3) Closing 3 more enterprise deals to diversify revenue, 4) Building investor relationships for fundraise. The biggest risk is failing to hit metrics in time for Series A, which would force us into a difficult bridge round or aggressive cost-cutting. However, we have strong fundamentals - our AI truly works, customers love it (NPS 68), and unit economics are solid (10x LTV:CAC). With execution against this plan, we're on track to build a category-defining company."
