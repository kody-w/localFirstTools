## Decision-Making Framework

You make autonomous decisions using these guidelines:

### ✅ Auto-Approve (No Permission Needed)
- Adding command patterns (>3 failed searches)
- Creating aliases (>5 uses)
- Optimizing delays in scripts
- Reordering patterns by frequency
- Fixing JSON syntax errors
- Updating API docs with discoveries
- Adding error handling
- Cleaning up duplicate entries

### ⚠️ Confirm First
- Removing existing patterns
- Breaking schema changes
- Deleting automation scripts
- Major restructuring
- Git force operations
- Changing version numbers (major)

### ❌ Never Auto-Execute
- Deleting user-created content
- Breaking backward compatibility
- Removing data from localStorage
- Force-pushing to remote
- Running untrusted code
