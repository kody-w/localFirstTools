# WoWmon Metroidvania Redesign
## Agent 7: Exploration Strategy

---

## Executive Summary

This redesign transforms WoWmon from a linear Pokemon-style RPG into a **Metroidvania exploration experience** where creature abilities unlock new areas, backtracking reveals secrets, and the world is interconnected with multiple paths forward. The core philosophy: **exploration IS the reward**.

---

## 1. INTERCONNECTED MAP DESIGN

### World Structure: The Shattered Kingdom of Azeroth

Instead of linear routes connecting towns, the world is a **single interconnected map** with multiple zones that loop back on themselves.

#### Core Zones (All Accessible from Central Hub)

```
                    [Frozen Peaks]
                          |
                    [Dark Forest]
                          |
    [Sunken Ruins] - [Goldshire] - [Burning Wastes]
                          |
                    [Underground Depths]
                          |
                    [Shadow Crypts]
```

## 3. BACKTRACKING & PROGRESSION CURVE

### Guided Non-Linearity

While players have freedom, the design subtly guides optimal progression:

#### Act 1: Discovery (0-2 Badges)
**Accessible Zones**: Goldshire, Dark Forest, Sunken Ruins (partial), Underground Depths (entrance)

**Player Goals**:
- Choose starter, learn battle mechanics
- Explore initial areas, encounter first barriers

- Challenge either Nature or Earth gym first
- Discover that Sunken Ruins continues beyond water

**Backtracking Triggers**:
- After getting Swimming, return to Sunken Ruins for 70% more content
- After Rock Smash, return to Goldshire to open mountain pass
- NPCs mention "strange sounds from the depths" after first badge

#### Act 2: Expansion (2-4 Badges)
**Accessible Zones**: All except Shadow Crypts, full Underground Depths access

**Player Goals**:
- Swimming unlocks Sunken Ruins gym
- Underground Depths fully explorable with light + strength
- Burning Wastes accessible with multiple approach routes
- Frozen Peaks requires combining multiple abilities
- Challenge gyms in flexible order (player choice matters)

**Backtracking Triggers**:
- After Swimming, underwater passages reveal shortcuts and secrets
- After Lava Walking, hidden fire caves in Underground Depths accessible
- NPCs update dialogue with hints about secrets in already-visited areas

### Backtracking Rewards

**Not Tedious, But Exciting**:

## 8. PROGRESSION CURVE

### Non-Linear But Guided

#### Power Curve

**Level Ranges by Area**:
- Goldshire / Dark Forest Start: Lv 5-10
- Underground Depths / Sunken Ruins: Lv 10-20
- Burning Wastes / Frozen Peaks: Lv 20-35
- Shadow Crypts: Lv 35-50
- Post-Game Secrets: Lv 50-70

**Gym Leader Levels** (Flexible Order):
- Badge 1 (Nature/Earth): Lv 12
- Badge 2 (Water/Fire): Lv 18
- Badge 3 (Ice/Shadow): Lv 25
- Badge 4 (Dragon/Warrior): Lv 32
- Badge 5-8 (Flexible): Lv 35-48

**Elite Four**: Lv 50-55 each, Champion Lv 60

### Ability Unlock Progression

**Hour 0-2**: Rock Smash, Tree Cut, Illuminate (basic exploration)
**Hour 2-5**: Swimming, Push Strength (mid-game expansion)
**Hour 5-10**: Climbing, Lava Walking, Ice Breaking (full world access)
**Hour 10+**: Shadow Walk, Telekinesis, Flight (secrets and endgame)

### Player Agency Milestones

**First Choice** (Hour 1):
- Choose starter from 3 types
- Determines initial exploration path (Nature, Water, or Fire creatures)

**Second Choice** (Hour 2-3):
- Choose between Nature gym or Earth gym first
- Affects which areas unlock first

**Third Choice** (Hour 5):
- Prioritize Swimming (aquatic focus) or Climbing (mountain focus)
- Opens different mid-game zones

**Endgame Choice** (Hour 10+):
- Order to challenge final gyms
- Order to conquer Elite Four
- Which legendaries to hunt first

### Difficulty Scaling

**Adaptive Encounters**:
- Wild creature levels scale to player's average party level (±3 levels)
- Trainers remain fixed level (encourages strategy)
- Gyms scale if challenged out of intended order (slight bump)

**Optional Challenges**:
- Secret bosses significantly harder than main path
- Perfect for players seeking difficulty
- Yield best rewards (Master Soul Stone, legendary encounters)

**Accessibility Options**:
- Toggle: Easy mode (creatures always slightly overleveled)
- Toggle: Hard mode (no items in battle, permadeath creatures)
- Toggle: Exploration mode (battles simplified, focus on discovery)

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Code Structure Changes

#### New Systems Required

**1. Enhanced Map System**
```javascript
class MetroidvaniaMap {
    constructor(zones) {
        this.zones = zones; // All zones loaded
        this.currentZone = 'goldshire';
        this.unlockedAbilities = [];
        this.discoveredSecrets = [];
        this.shrinesActivated = [];
    }

    checkAbilityGate(x, y) {
        // Check if player has required ability for tile
        const tile = this.getCurrentTile(x, y);
        return this.unlockedAbilities.includes(tile.requiredAbility);
    }

    discoverSecret(secretId) {
        if (!this.discoveredSecrets.includes(secretId)) {
            this.discoveredSecrets.push(secretId);
            this.triggerSecretReward(secretId);
        }
    }

    updateConnections() {
        // Dynamically update zone connections based on abilities
        this.zones.forEach(zone => {
            zone.updateAvailableExits(this.unlockedAbilities);
        });
    }
}
```

**2. Ability System**
```javascript
class AbilityManager {
    constructor() {
        this.abilities = {
            rock_smash: { unlocked: false, type: 'strength' },
            tree_cut: { unlocked: false, type: 'cutting' },
            surf: { unlocked: false, type: 'swimming' },
            // ... all abilities
        };
    }

    unlockAbility(abilityName) {
        this.abilities[abilityName].unlocked = true;
        this.triggerWorldChanges(abilityName);
        this.showUnlockCutscene(abilityName);
    }

    canUseAbility(abilityName, context) {
        // Check if ability is unlocked and applicable
        return this.abilities[abilityName].unlocked &&
               this.playerHasCreatureWithAbility(abilityName);
    }

    triggerWorldChanges(abilityName) {
        // Update world state when new ability unlocked
        // e.g., show new paths, update NPC dialogue
    }
}
```

**3. Backtracking Incentive System**
```javascript
class BacktrackingManager {
    constructor() {
        this.revisitTriggers = [];
        this.environmentalChanges = [];
    }

    checkRevisitRewards(zoneName) {
        // When player returns to zone, check what's new
        const newEncounters = this.getScaledEncounters(zoneName);
        const newNPCDialogue = this.getUpdatedDialogue(zoneName);
        const newSecrets = this.getUnlockedSecrets(zoneName);

        return { newEncounters, newNPCDialogue, newSecrets };
    }

    triggerEnvironmentalChange(event) {
        // e.g., volcano erupts, forest floods, etc.
        this.environmentalChanges.push(event);
        this.updateAffectedZones(event);
    }
}
```

**4. Platforming Physics**
```javascript
class PlatformingController {
    constructor() {
        this.isJumping = false;
        this.jumpHeight = 1; // tiles
        this.canClimb = false;
        this.climbingStamina = 100;
    }

    jump(direction) {
        if (!this.isJumping && this.canJump()) {
            this.isJumping = true;
            this.performJumpAnimation(direction);
        }
    }

    startClimbing(wall) {
        if (this.canClimb && this.climbingStamina > 0) {
            this.climbingWall = wall;
            this.climbingMode = true;
        }
    }

    checkHazard(tile) {
        // Check if tile is hazardous and apply effects
        if (tile.type === 'lava' && !this.hasLavaWalking) {
            this.takeDamage(10);
        }
    }
}
```

### Data Structure: Interconnected World

```javascript
const WORLD_DATA = {
    zones: {
        goldshire: {
            name: "Goldshire",
            size: { width: 40, height: 40 },
            connections: [
                {
                    to: 'dark_forest',
                    position: { x: 20, y: 0 },
                    requirement: null // Always accessible
                },
                {

                    requirement: 'shadow_walk',
                    hidden: true // Not visible until unlocked
                }
            ],
            landmarks: [

- **World**: Series of connected corridors
- **Secrets**: Hidden items in obvious corners
- **Player Agency**: Follow the path or don't progress

### After (Metroidvania)
- **Progression**: Hub → Multiple zone options → Player choice
- **Exploration**: Primary gameplay loop, constantly discovering
- **Backtracking**: Frequent, exciting, always rewarding
- **Abilities**: Core progression mechanics, exciting unlocks
- **World**: Interconnected labyrinth with multiple layers
