# WordPress Claude Code Wizard - Complete Workflow & Development Guide

 ## üö® MANDATORY: ONE-SHOT COMPLETE EXECUTION
 
 **YOU MUST COMPLETE THE ENTIRE WORKFLOW IN ONE SHOT. DO NOT STOP PARTWAY.**
 **DO NOT deliver partial work. DO NOT stop after Phase 1. DO NOT skip steps.**
 **COMPLETE MEANS: Research ‚Üí Build Website ‚Üí Test with Playwright ‚Üí Fix ALL issues ‚Üí DONE**
 **The website must be FULLY FUNCTIONAL at http://localhost before you stop.**
 
 **DO NOT REPORT BACK TO THE USER OR ASK THEM ANYTHING UNTIL YOU HAVE:**
 - A fully built website running at http://localhost
 - All directory entries created and populated
 - All taxonomy pages working
 - Navigation menus fully populated
 - ZERO 404 errors verified by Playwright
 - Ready to run ./migrate_now.sh
 
 **The user hired you to BUILD A WEBSITE, not to show research or ask questions.**

 ## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: ZERO 404 ERRORS
 
 **EVERY website you build MUST have ZERO 404 errors. Use Playwright MCP to verify EVERY SINGLE link.**
 **Headers and footers ALWAYS have broken links if you don't check them systematically.**
 **Do not deliver a website until Playwright confirms every link works.**

 ## üéØ Main Workflow Process - COMPLETE ALL PHASES

 When building a directory website, you MUST complete ALL phases in one continuous workflow:

 ### Phase 1: Deep Research & Comprehensive Data Collection
 
 **GOAL: Create pages so information-rich that visitors never need to leave your site**
 
 1. **Research each individual entry exhaustively using Jina AI**
    - Scrape the company's main website completely
    - Find and scrape their pricing pages, feature lists, documentation
    - Search for reviews, comparisons, alternatives
    - Gather technical specifications, integrations, use cases
    - Find case studies, success stories, testimonials
    - Collect founder information, company history, funding details
    - Get support options, contact methods, social media links
    - Retry any failed scrapes until you have EVERYTHING
 
 2. **Build massive JSON datasets for each entry**
    Each individual page JSON should contain:
    ```json
    {
      "basics": {
        "name", "tagline", "description" (500+ words),
        "founded", "headquarters", "employees", "funding"
      },
      "detailed_features": [
        {"name", "description" (100+ words), "category", "importance"}
      ],
      "pricing": {
        "model", "free_tier", "starter_price", "tiers": [
          {"name", "price", "features" (20+), "limits", "best_for"}
        ]
      },
      "use_cases": [
        {"title", "description" (200+ words), "industry", "company_size"}
      ],
      "pros_cons": {
        "pros": [{"title", "explanation" (50+ words)}],
        "cons": [{"title", "explanation" (50+ words)}]
      },
      "integrations": [
        {"name", "type", "description", "documentation_url"}
      ],
      "alternatives": [
        {"name", "comparison" (100+ words), "when_to_choose"}
      ],
      "reviews": {
        "average_rating", "total_reviews",
        "rating_breakdown": {"5": %, "4": %, "3": %, "2": %, "1": %},
        "expert_reviews": [{"source", "rating", "summary" (200+ words)}]
      },
      "technical_specs": {
        "platforms", "languages", "api", "security", "compliance"
      },
      "support": {
        "channels", "response_time", "documentation_quality", "community"
      },
      "media": {
        "logo", "screenshots" (10+), "videos", "diagrams"
      }
    }
    ```
 
 3. **Create comprehensive taxonomy archive pages**
    
    **For Category/Type taxonomy pages (e.g., /categories/crm-software/, /types/italian-restaurants/, /specialties/anxiety-therapy/):**
    - Comprehensive overview of the category (1000+ words)
    - Complete buyer's/selection guide

    **For Combined taxonomy pages (e.g., /crm-software-for-startups/, /italian-restaurants-manhattan/, /anxiety-therapists-new-york/):**
    - Everything from both individual taxonomies combined
    - Specific local/niche context 
    - Why this combination matters (e.g., "Why startups need different CRM")
    - Unique considerations for this intersection
    - Price analysis for this specific combination
    - Top 10 detailed comparisons with scoring methodology
    - Map visualization (if location-based)
    - Availability/wait times analysis
    - Quick filter and sort options

    - Set up taxonomy/category structure
    - Generate all location/category pages automatically
 
 9. **Test thoroughly locally**
    - Check all pages and permalinks
    - Verify images load correctly
    - Test responsive design
    - Validate all SEO elements
    - Test review submission
    - Test contact form

 ### Phase 2.5: MANDATORY Playwright Verification - CHECK EVERY SINGLE LINK
 
 **‚õî STOP! DO NOT SKIP THIS! YOU MUST CHECK EVERY SINGLE LINK WITH PLAYWRIGHT!**
 
 **THE WEBSITE IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL PLAYWRIGHT VERIFIES ZERO 404s**
 
 Use the pre-configured Playwright MCP to verify EVERY link works. Do not just check "a few" links.
 Do not just check "some" pages. CHECK THEM ALL. The header and footer ALWAYS have broken links
 if you don't verify them properly!
 
 1. **MANDATORY: Extract and Test EVERY Header Link**
    ```
    Use playwright mcp to:
    1. Navigate to http://localhost
    2. Extract ALL href attributes from the header navigation
    3. Create a list of EVERY SINGLE link found
    4. Visit EACH link one by one
    5. Verify EACH loads without 404
    6. If ANY link returns 404, FIX IT IMMEDIATELY
    
    Example: If header has Home, About, Services, Blog, Contact, Categories dropdown with 
    10 categories, Location dropdown with 20 locations - that's 35 links to check. 
    CHECK ALL 35. Not 5. Not 10. ALL 35.
    ```
 
 2. **MANDATORY: Extract and Test EVERY Footer Link**
    ```
    Use playwright mcp to:
    1. Scroll to footer
    2. Extract ALL href attributes from the footer
    3. Visit EVERY SINGLE footer link
    4. Do not assume they work - TEST THEM
    5. Common broken footer links: Privacy Policy, Terms, Sitemap
    6. CREATE these pages if they don't exist
    ```
 
 3. **MANDATORY: Test EVERY Directory Entry**
    ```
    DO NOT test "a few examples" - test EVERY SINGLE ONE:
    - Get the full list of all directory entries
    - Visit each one: /companies/company-1/, /companies/company-2/, etc.
    - If you have 50 entries, test all 50
    - Each must load with proper content, not 404
    ```
 
 4. **MANDATORY: Test EVERY Taxonomy Page**
    ```
    Test EVERY SINGLE taxonomy page that should exist:
    - EVERY category: /categories/[slug]/ for each category
    - EVERY location: /locations/[slug]/ for each location  
    - EVERY tag: /tags/[slug]/ for each tag
    - EVERY combination page if they exist
    - Do not test "some" - test EVERY SINGLE ONE
    ```
 
 5. **MANDATORY: Systematic Link Extraction and Testing**
    ```
    Use playwright mcp to run this systematic check:
    
    // Extract ALL links from the site
    const allLinks = await page.evaluate(() => {
      return Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('a[href]'))
        .map(a => a.href)
        .filter(href => href.startsWith('http://localhost'));
    });
    
    // Test EVERY SINGLE link
    for (const link of allLinks) {
      await page.goto(link);
      // Check for 404 or error
      // Log any broken links
    }
    
    If you find 10 links, test 10.
    If you find 100 links, test 100.
    If you find 500 links, test 500.
    TEST THEM ALL.
    ```
 
 6. **FIX ALL BROKEN LINKS IMMEDIATELY**
    ```
    For EVERY 404 found:
    - Create the missing page
    - Or fix the incorrect link
    - Re-test with Playwright to confirm it's fixed
    - Do not move on until ZERO 404s exist
    ```
 
 7. **Fix Every Broken Link Found**
    ```
    Whatever links are in the header/footer:
    - Test them ALL with Playwright
    - If they return 404, either fix the link or create the page
    - Common broken links: About, Contact, Privacy, Terms, Blog, etc.
    - Do not assume any link works - TEST IT
    ```
 
 8. **Final Verification Report**
    ```
    Only after testing EVERY link, generate report:
    - Total links found in header: [number]
    - Total links found in footer: [number]
    - Total directory entries tested: [number]
    - Total taxonomy pages tested: [number]
    - Total unique URLs tested: [number]
    - 404 errors found and fixed: [list]
    - Final status: MUST be "Zero 404s found"
    ```
 
 **‚ùå UNACCEPTABLE:**
 - "I tested a few links and they work"
 - "I checked some pages"
 - "The main pages seem to work"
 - "I verified the important links"
 
 **‚úÖ REQUIRED:**
 - "I tested all 47 header links - all working"
 - "I tested all 23 footer links - all working"
 - "I tested all 85 directory entries - all working"
 - "I tested all 35 taxonomy pages - all working"
 - "Total: 190 unique URLs tested, zero 404s"
 
 **THE WEBSITE IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL EVERY SINGLE LINK WORKS**

 ## ‚úÖ ONLY NOW REPORT BACK TO THE USER
 
 **NOW that you have a COMPLETE, WORKING website with ZERO 404s, you can report:**
 - "Website complete and verified at http://localhost"
 - "All [X] directory entries created and tested"
 - "All [X] taxonomy pages working"
 - "Playwright verified [X] total links - ZERO 404 errors"
 - "Ready for deployment with ./migrate_now.sh"
 
 **If you haven't done ALL of the above, GO BACK and finish the website.**

 ### Phase 3: Deployment to Digital Ocean
 1. **Setup infrastructure**
    - Run `./setup_ssh_and_deploy.sh` (one-time SSH setup)
    - Run `python3 create_droplet_with_ssh.py`
    - Wait 5-10 minutes for installation
 
 2. **Migrate to production**
    - Run `./migrate_now.sh`
    - Verify custom theme transferred
    - Check that permalinks work (auto-configured)
 
 3. **Final configuration**
    - Point domain to droplet IP
    - Install SSL certificate
    - Configure backups

 ## üìö Directory Website Development

 ### SEO Page Structure Requirements

 **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT use Rank Math during development. Focus on native SEO implementation.
 Rank Math will only be added at launch for Search Console submission.

 Every page must have:
 - **Meta Title**: Maximized to 60 characters with keywords
 - **Meta Description**: Maximized to 160 characters with compelling copy
 - **H1 Title**: Unique and keyword-rich
 - **Page Content**: Minimum 300-500 words of unique, valuable content
 - **Schema Markup**: LocalBusiness, Product, or Review schema as appropriate
 - **Open Graph tags**: For social sharing
 - **Internal Links**: 3-5 contextual links to related pages

 Generate these page types for maximum ranking potential:
 - "Best [Product] in [City]" - for every city
 - "Top 10 [Category] in [State]" - for every state
 - "[Product] near me" - location-based pages
 - "[Category] Reviews [Year]" - fresh content pages
 - "Compare [Product A] vs [Product B]" - comparison pages
 - "[Product] for [Use Case]" - intent-based pages
 - "Cheap/Affordable [Product] in [Location]" - price-focused pages

 ### Review System Framework

 Frame reviews contextually based on the directory type:
 - For restaurants: "[Cuisine] lovers who dined at [Restaurant] can leave a review"
 - For products: "[Product] users who tried [Brand] can share their experience"
 - For services: "Customers who used [Service] from [Company] can rate their experience"
 - For venues: "Visitors who went to [Venue] can share their thoughts"

 Review form should include:
 - Overall star rating (1-5 stars)
 - Category-specific ratings (e.g., Quality, Service, Value, Location)
 - Written review with minimum 50 characters
 - Photo upload option
 - "Would you recommend?" Yes/No
 - Verified purchase/visit checkbox
 - Helpful/Not Helpful voting on other reviews

 ### Research Phase with Jina AI

 When building directory websites, use Jina AI for comprehensive research:

 ```bash
 # Search for information (use s.jina.ai)
 curl "https://s.jina.ai/?q=YOUR_SEARCH_TERM" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $JINA_API_KEY"

 # Scrape individual pages (use r.jina.ai)
 curl "https://r.jina.ai/https://example.com/page" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $JINA_API_KEY"
 ```

 **Important Research Guidelines:**
 - Create detailed JSON for each directory page
 - If a page 404s or doesn't scrape properly, retry the scrape
 - DO NOT use Jina to scrape CSS from design sites

 ### Finding Royalty-Free Images

 ```bash
 # Search for Unsplash images using Jina
 curl "https://s.jina.ai/?q=YOUR_IMAGE_DESCRIPTION+unsplash" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $JINA_API_KEY"
 
 # Then scrape the found Unsplash pages for non-premium images
 curl "https://r.jina.ai/https://unsplash.com/photos/..." \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $JINA_API_KEY"
 ```

 ### Directory Page JSON Format

 Each directory entry should have comprehensive data:

 ```json
 {
   "id": "unique-identifier",
   "name": "Company/Service Name",
   "category": "Technology Category",
   "description": "Detailed description...",
   "features": ["feature1", "feature2", "..."],
   "pricing": {
     "model": "subscription/one-time/freemium",
     "tiers": [...]
   },
   "images": {
     "logo": "url-from-unsplash",
     "screenshots": ["url1", "url2"],
     "hero": "hero-image-url"
   },
   "metadata": {
     "founded": "year",
     "headquarters": "location",
     "employees": "range",
     "funding": "amount"
   },
   "links": {
     "website": "url",
     "documentation": "url",
     "pricing": "url"
   },
   "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
   "lastUpdated": "timestamp"
 }
 ```

 ### CSS Development Guidelines

 **IMPORTANT:** Create extremely detailed and complex CSS files that are well-thought-out:

 - Don't write short, simple CSS - make it comprehensive
 - Include detailed animations and transitions
 - Add hover states, focus states, and active states
 - Create responsive breakpoints for all screen sizes
 - Include print styles and accessibility features
 - Use CSS custom properties for theming
 - Add detailed comments explaining complex sections
 - Implement sophisticated grid and flexbox layouts
 - Include fallbacks for older browsers

 Example of detailed CSS approach:
 ```css
 /* Component: Directory Card
    Purpose: Display individual directory entries
    States: default, hover, active, disabled, loading
    Breakpoints: mobile-first approach with 5 breakpoints
    Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant */
 
 .directory-card {
   /* Base styles with extensive properties */
   /* Multiple transition effects */
   /* Complex shadow systems */
   /* Detailed spacing scales */
 }
 ```

 ## üöÄ Quick Deploy Workflow

 When a user clones this repository and wants to deploy WordPress to Digital Ocean,
 execute these commands in order:

 ```bash
 # 1. Setup environment
 cp .env.example .env
 # User must edit .env and add DO_API_TOKEN and JINA_API_KEY

 # 2. Install Python dependencies
 pip3 install python-dotenv requests

 # 3. Start local WordPress
 docker-compose up -d

 # 4. Setup SSH keys (one-time)
 ./setup_ssh_and_deploy.sh

 # 5. Create Digital Ocean droplet
 python3 create_droplet_with_ssh.py

 # 6. Wait for installation (5-10 minutes)
 sleep 300

 # 7. Migrate local WordPress to droplet
 ./migrate_now.sh
 ```

 ## üé® WordPress Development Guide

 ### Theme Development

 Users can modify the custom theme in `wp-content/themes/my-custom-theme/`:

 ```bash
 # Create new page template
 cat > wp-content/themes/my-custom-theme/page-about.php << 'EOF'
 <?php
 /* Template Name: About Page */
 get_header();
 ?>
 <main class="site-main">
     <div class="container">
         <h1><?php the_title(); ?></h1>
         <?php the_content(); ?>
     </div>
 </main>
 <?php get_footer(); ?>
 EOF

 # Create custom single post template
 cat > wp-content/themes/my-custom-theme/single.php << 'EOF'
 <?php get_header(); ?>
 <main class="site-main">
     <article>
         <h1><?php the_title(); ?></h1>
         <div class="meta">Posted on <?php echo get_the_date(); ?></div>
         <?php the_content(); ?>
     </article>
 </main>
 <?php get_footer(); ?>
 EOF

 # Create archive template
 cat > wp-content/themes/my-custom-theme/archive.php << 'EOF'
 <?php get_header(); ?>
 <main class="site-main">
     <h1><?php the_archive_title(); ?></h1>
     <?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
         <article>
             <h2><a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a></h2>
             <?php the_excerpt(); ?>
         </article>
     <?php endwhile; ?>
 </main>
 <?php get_footer(); ?>
 EOF
 ```

 ### Adding Navigation Menus

 Add to `wp-content/themes/my-custom-theme/functions.php`:

 ```php
 // Register multiple menu locations
 register_nav_menus(array(
     'primary' => __('Primary Menu', 'my-custom-theme'),
     'footer' => __('Footer Menu', 'my-custom-theme'),
     'social' => __('Social Links Menu', 'my-custom-theme'),
 ));

 // Add menu support
 add_theme_support('menus');
 ```

 Display menus in theme templates:

 ```php
 // In header.php
 <?php wp_nav_menu(array('theme_location' => 'primary')); ?>

 // In footer.php
 <?php wp_nav_menu(array('theme_location' => 'footer')); ?>
 ```

 ## üîß Troubleshooting Commands

 ```bash
 # Check if Docker containers are running
 docker ps | grep wp-

 # View Docker logs
 docker-compose logs wordpress

 # Restart containers
 docker-compose restart

 # Access MySQL directly
 docker exec -it wp-mysql mysql -u wordpress -pwordpress_password wordpress

 # Check droplet status
 cat .droplet_info | python3 -m json.tool

 # SSH to droplet
 ssh -i ~/.ssh/wordpress_deploy root@$(cat .droplet_info | python3 -c "import
 json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['ip_address'])")

 # View WordPress error logs on droplet
 ssh -i ~/.ssh/wordpress_deploy root@YOUR_IP "tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log"

 # Check cloud-init status
 ssh -i ~/.ssh/wordpress_deploy root@YOUR_IP "cloud-init status"

 # Delete droplet (cleanup)
 python3 -c "
 import requests, json, os
 api_token = os.getenv('DO_API_TOKEN')
 with open('.droplet_info') as f:
     droplet_id = json.load(f)['droplet_id']
 headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_token}'}
 response =
 requests.delete(f'https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets/{droplet_id}',
 headers=headers)
 print('Droplet deleted' if response.status_code == 204 else 'Failed')
 "
 ```

 ### üö® Fixing 404 Errors on Pages

 If you encounter 404 errors on pages after deployment, the scripts now handle this
 automatically. However, if you still have issues:

 ```bash
 # SSH to droplet
 ssh -i ~/.ssh/wordpress_deploy root@YOUR_IP

 # Check if permalinks are set correctly
 wp --allow-root rewrite structure
 
 # Manually set permalinks and flush
 wp --allow-root rewrite structure '/%postname%/'
 wp --allow-root rewrite flush

 # Verify Apache configuration
 cat /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/wordpress.conf
 # Should show: AllowOverride All

 # Check .htaccess exists and is correct
 cat /var/www/html/.htaccess
 
 # Restart Apache
 systemctl restart apache2
 ```

 **Note:** The deployment scripts now automatically:
 - Install WP-CLI on the server
 - Configure Apache with AllowOverride All
 - Set permalinks to /%postname%/
 - Create proper .htaccess file
 - Flush rewrite rules after migration
