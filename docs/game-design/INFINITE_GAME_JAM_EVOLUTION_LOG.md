## Experiment Configuration

### Starting DNA (Generation 0)
```json
{
  "playerSpeed": 5,
  "jumpForce": 12,
  "gravity": 0.5,
  "airControl": 0.8,
  "platformWidth": 100,
  "platformGap": 150,
  "platformVariance": 50,
  "movingPlatformChance": 0.2,
  "movingPlatformSpeed": 2,
  "obstacleChance": 0.3,
  "obstacleSpeed": 3,
  "obstacleSize": 30,
  "coinChance": 0.5,
  "coinValue": 10,
  "powerupChance": 0.1,
  "difficultyRamp": 0.001,
  "maxDifficulty": 2.0,
  "scrollSpeed": 3
}
```

### Evolution Strategy
- **Cycles 1-10**: Conservative mutations (baseline establishment)
- **Cycles 11-30**: Aggressive exploration based on patterns discovered
- **Cycles 31-50**: Refinement and optimization
- **Milestones**: Save snapshots every 10 generations
