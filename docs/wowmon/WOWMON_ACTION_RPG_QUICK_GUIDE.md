## Stamina Management

### Action Costs
```

Heavy Attack:     30 stamina
Dodge Roll:       25 stamina
Block (per sec):   5 stamina
Weapon Art:       40 stamina
```

### Stamina Strategy
- **BAD**: Spam attacks until empty → Stamina Break → 2 sec vulnerable
- **GOOD**: 2-hit combo → Dodge out → Regen → Re-engage
- **BEST**: Parry → Riposte (gains stamina!) → Combo

### Soft/Hard Caps
- Regenerates at 25/sec when not attacking/blocking
- Max stamina increases with Endurance stat
- Different armor affects regen speed:
  - Heavy Armor: -30% regen
  - Medium Armor: Normal regen
  - Light Armor: +30% regen

## Boss Combat Guide

### Boss Telegraph System
```
Yellow = Early Warning (0-50% telegraph)
Orange = Get Ready (50-80% telegraph)
Red = DODGE NOW (80-100% telegraph)
```

### Attack Types & How to Counter
1. **Melee Attack**: Parry or dodge to side
2. **AoE Circle**: See red circle → Roll OUT
3. **Charge Attack**: Dodge perpendicular to charge direction
4. **Combo**: Dodge first hit, then roll through remaining hits
5. **Guard Break**: Don't block! Must dodge
6. **Grab**: Cannot block, must dodge (instant kill if caught)

### Phase Transitions
- Most bosses have 2-3 phases
- Phases trigger at 50% and 25% HP
- Boss often heals 25% during transition
- New attacks unlock each phase
- Get aggressive during transition animation (free damage!)

### Poise System
- Every boss has a Poise meter (hidden)
- Heavy attacks deal more poise damage
- When poise breaks → Boss stunned for 3 seconds
- FREE DAMAGE WINDOW!
- Poise resets after stun ends

## Death & Respawn

### What Happens When You Die
1. Drop 50% EXP and 30% Gold at death location
2. Blood Stain appears where you died
3. Respawn at last bonfire with full HP/Stamina
4. All non-boss enemies respawn
5. You have ONE chance to recover your souls

### Recovering Souls
- Walk to your Blood Stain location
- Touch it to recover EXP and Gold
- **WARNING**: If you die before recovering, souls are LOST FOREVER

### Death Strategy
- Return to bonfire BEFORE exploring if carrying lots of souls
- Don't get greedy! Better to retreat than lose everything
- Learn boss patterns with practice runs (0 souls to lose)
