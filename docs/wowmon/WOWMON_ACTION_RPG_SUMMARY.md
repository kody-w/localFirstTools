# WoWMon Action RPG Redesign - Executive Summary

## Transformation Overview

**From:** Turn-based Pokemon clone with menu navigation
**To:** Skill-based Souls-like action RPG with real-time combat

---

## Core Design Pillars

### 1. Skill Over Stats
- Player skill determines success more than character level
- Skilled players can beat high-level content at low levels
- Memorization of boss patterns rewarded
- Perfect execution > grinding for levels

### 2. High-Stakes Combat
- Every action costs stamina - resource management is critical
- Death has real consequences (lose 50% XP, 30% gold)
- Can recover souls ONE time before they're lost forever
- Combat is dangerous, not a formality

### 3. Meaningful Difficulty
- Challenging but always fair
- All attacks are telegraphed with visual warnings
- Consistent rules for player and enemies
- Learning curve: Each area teaches new skills

### 4. Build Diversity
- 6+ distinct playstyles (STR, DEX, INT, FAI, hybrid builds)
- Weapon choice dramatically changes gameplay
- Armor affects stamina regen and dodge costs
- No "best" build - all viable with different skill requirements

### 5. Interconnected World
- Metroidvania-style world with shortcuts
- Unlocking shortcuts more valuable than fast travel
- Areas connect in multiple ways
- Exploration rewarded with powerful secrets

## Major System Changes

### Combat System

#### OLD (Turn-Based)
```
Player selects "Attack" from menu
↓
Wait for animation
↓
Enemy takes turn
↓
Repeat until someone dies
```

**Problems:**
- Passive, not engaging
- No player skill expression
- Predictable and repetitive
- Victory determined by stats, not skill

#### NEW (Real-Time Action)
```
Player presses attack button
↓
100ms startup (vulnerable)
↓
150ms active hitbox (can hit)
↓
150ms recovery (can roll-cancel)
↓
Enemy AI reacts in real-time
```

**Improvements:**
- Frame-perfect timing matters
- Combos require rhythm and precision
- Dodge has 200ms invincibility frames
- Parry requires 150ms perfect timing
- Every action is a strategic choice

### Key Mechanics

**Stamina System**
- Every action costs stamina (attacks, dodges, blocks)
- Regenerates at 25/second when neutral
- Running out = 2 second vulnerability (Stamina Break)
- Forces measured aggression vs. button mashing

**Parry/Riposte**
- Block right before enemy hits (150ms window)
- Perfect parry: +30 stamina, enemy stunned
- Can riposte for 3x damage
- High skill ceiling, high reward

**Lock-On Targeting**
- Z-targeting like Souls/Zelda
- Auto-face locked enemy
- Easier to manage distance and dodge
- Can cycle between multiple enemies

**Poise System**
- Enemies have hidden poise meter
- Heavy attacks break poise
- Poise broken = 3 seconds of vulnerability
- Adds strategic layer to combat

---

## Boss Design Philosophy

### The Souls Formula

1. **Clear Telegraphs**
   - Yellow (early warning)
   - Orange (get ready)
   - Red (DODGE NOW!)

2. **Learnable Patterns**
   - Bosses have attack pools
   - AI chooses based on distance and player behavior
   - Pattern recognition = mastery

3. **Phase Transitions**
   - 2-3 phases per boss
   - New attacks each phase
   - Transition = free damage window

4. **Fair but Challenging**
   - Always recovery windows to heal
   - Every attack is dodgeable
   - Death teaches lessons

### Example: Hogger (Early Boss)

**Phase 1 (100-50% HP)**
- Claw Swipe: Basic melee (teaches parry timing)
- Leap: Charge attack (teaches dodge direction)
- Howl: Buff (teaches interruption)

**Phase 2 (50-0% HP)**
- Ground Slam: AoE attack (teaches roll timing)
- Triple Swipe: Combo with guard break (teaches not to rely on block)
- Summon Adds: 2 gnoll minions (teaches target priority)

**Learning Progression:**
- Attempt 1: Learn patterns, die
- Attempt 2-5: Practice dodges, improve
- Attempt 6+: Master fight, victory

---

## Death & Progression

### The Stakes

**When You Die:**
1. Drop 50% experience and 30% gold at death location
2. Blood stain appears where you died
3. Respawn at last bonfire with full HP
4. ALL enemies respawn (except bosses)
5. ONE chance to recover your souls

**Risk/Reward Decision:**
"I'm at 30% HP, no healing left, carrying 1000 souls.
Do I push forward or go back to bonfire?"

This tension is THE CORE of Souls gameplay.

### Bonfire System

**Bonfires Are:**
- Checkpoints (respawn location)
- Healing stations (restore HP/stamina/items)
- Fast travel points
- Level up locations

**Trade-off:**
- Resting fully heals you
- BUT respawns all enemies
- Safe vs. Efficient

### Build Progression

**Stat Allocation:**
- Vigor: HP (soft cap 40, hard cap 60)
- Endurance: Stamina (soft cap 40, hard cap 60)
- Strength: Physical damage, heavy weapons
- Dexterity: Attack speed, light weapons
- Intelligence: Magic damage
- Faith: Healing, holy damage

**Weapon Scaling:**
- Weapons scale with stats (S > A > B > C > D > E)
- Example: Great Axe (STR: A, DEX: E) = STR build
- Example: Dual Daggers (STR: E, DEX: A) = DEX build

## World Structure

### Interconnected Design

```
Starting Area: Elwynn Forest
├─ Westfall (path) → Hogger Boss
│  ├─ Deadmines (dungeon)
│  └─ Duskwood (path)
├─ Redridge Mountains (path)
│  └─ Burning Steppes (mountain pass)
│     └─ Onyxia's Lair (boss gate)
└─ Stormwind (locked gate)
```

### Shortcuts Are Everything

**Example Shortcut Value:**
- First time: 5 minute walk from bonfire to boss
- Unlock elevator: 30 second ride
- Value: 4.5 minutes saved per boss attempt

With 20 boss attempts, shortcut saves 90 minutes!

### Exploration Rewards

- Hidden paths lead to powerful gear
- Secret bosses for hardcore players
- Lore items for story enthusiasts
- Optional areas for completionists

## Why This Works

### The Souls Formula

1. **Challenging but Fair**
   - Every death is a lesson
   - Pattern recognition wins
   - "I can beat this!" mentality

2. **Risk/Reward Tension**
   - Souls at stake creates drama
   - Every decision matters
   - High engagement

3. **Skill Expression**
   - Builds are diverse
   - Playstyles are distinct
   - Mastery is visible

4. **Memorable Moments**
   - First boss kill feels EARNED
   - Perfect parry is satisfying
   - Recovery runs are tense

### Gameplay Loop

```
Die to boss
↓
"I can beat this!"
↓
Learn patterns
↓
Practice timing
↓
Get closer to victory
↓
FINALLY WIN!
↓
Euphoria + Sense of accomplishment
↓
"What's the next boss?"
```

This loop is ADDICTIVE because:
- Challenge is fair (not frustrating)
- Progress is measurable
- Victory feels earned
- Mastery is rewarding
