## 1. SURVIVAL MECHANICS

### Core Survival Stats
Players must manage four critical survival statistics:

#### Health (‚ù§Ô∏è)
- **Range**: 0-100
- **Purpose**: Primary life force
- **Depletion Causes**:
  - Combat with wild creatures
  - Eating raw/poisoned food
  - Extreme weather exposure
  - Starvation/dehydration
- **Restoration Methods**:
  - Eating cooked food
  - Resting in shelter
  - Healing items
  - Companion abilities (Wisp healing)

#### Hunger (üçñ)
- **Range**: 0-100
- **Depletion Rate**: ~0.5 per minute
- **Critical Threshold**: Below 20 triggers health damage
- **Restoration Methods**:
  - Eating berries (+10)
  - Cooked meat (+30)
  - Cooked fish (+25)
  - Mushrooms (+8)
- **Effects When Low**:
  - Energy regeneration stops
  - Movement speed reduced
  - Health slowly decreases

#### Thirst (üíß)
- **Range**: 0-100
- **Depletion Rate**: ~0.7 per minute (faster than hunger)
- **Critical Threshold**: Below 20 causes rapid health loss
- **Restoration Methods**:
  - Dirty water (+10, -3 health)
  - Clean water (+30, safe)
  - Found in water biomes
- **Effects When Low**:
  - All stats regenerate slower
  - Vision slightly blurred (visual effect)
  - Severe penalties below 10

#### Energy (‚ö°)
- **Range**: 0-100
- **Depletion Causes**:
  - Movement (-0.1 per step)
  - Gathering resources (-2-5 per action)
  - Crafting (-5-10 per item)
  - Combat actions
- **Restoration Methods**:
  - Resting (+50, advances 2 hours)
  - Eating mushrooms (+5)
  - Sleeping in shelter (full restore)
- **Effects When Low**:
  - Cannot sprint
  - Cannot perform heavy tasks
  - Actions take longer

### Survival Degradation System
```javascript
// Continuous passive degradation
Every game tick (~1 second):
  hunger -= 0.008 (100 in ~12.5 minutes real time)
  thirst -= 0.012 (100 in ~8 minutes real time)

  if (energy < 30) {
    health -= 0.1
  }

  if (hunger < 20) {
    health -= 0.5
    energy regeneration stopped
  }

  if (thirst < 20) {
    health -= 0.8
    all stats regen halved
  }
```

## 10. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principles

#### 1. Resource Management is Key
Every action has a cost. Players must constantly balance:
- Survival stats (health, hunger, thirst, energy)
- Inventory space (limited slots)
- Tool durability (finite uses)
- Companion loyalty (daily maintenance)
- Time management (day/night cycle)

**Design Intent**: Create meaningful decisions where players must prioritize actions. No autopilot gameplay.

#### 2. Creatures as Tools and Companions
Unlike traditional Pokemon games where creatures are primarily for combat, WoWmon Survival treats creatures as:
- **Gathering assistants**: Increase resource yield
- **Utility providers**: Light, healing, speed, protection
- **Combat support**: But not the primary focus
- **Emotional bonds**: Loyalty system creates attachment

**Design Intent**: Creatures solve problems and enable strategies rather than being collectibles.

#### 3. Building and Progression
The base is the player's home and represents progress:
- **Visual progression**: Small tent ‚Üí fortified compound
- **Functional upgrades**: Each structure unlocks capabilities
- **Personal expression**: Player-designed layouts
- **Safe haven**: Protection from hazards

**Design Intent**: Create a sense of ownership and permanence. The base is earned, not given.

#### 4. Survival Challenge
The wilderness is hostile but fair:
- **Clear feedback**: Players always know why they're taking damage
- **Multiple solutions**: Various strategies for same problem
- **Learning curve**: Starts accessible, becomes challenging
- **Death is meaningful**: Lose items but can recover

**Design Intent**: Tension without frustration. Players should feel accomplished when surviving, not relieved.

#### 5. Exploration Rewarded
The world encourages curiosity:
- **Distance = reward**: Better loot further from spawn
- **Hidden secrets**: POIs, rare creatures, Easter eggs
- **Biome diversity**: Each area has unique resources
- **Navigation tools**: Players aren't forced to memorize

**Design Intent**: Reward brave explorers without punishing cautious players.

### Player Retention Strategies

  - Multi-step crafting chains
  - Companion leveling
  - POI discovery

60+ minutes:

```

#### Long-Term Engagement (Multi-Session Goals)
```

```

### Balance Considerations

#### Difficulty Curve
```
Tutorial Zone (First 30 minutes):
  - Abundant resources nearby
  - No predators
  - Forgiving survival stats
  - Clear objectives

Early Game (Hours 1-3):
  - Resources require travel
  - Weak predators at night
  - Survival stats matter
  - Player-driven goals

Mid Game (Hours 3-10):
  - Resources gated by tools
  - Dangerous creatures
  - Weather challenges
  - Complex crafting chains

Late Game (Hours 10+):
  - Rare resources far away
  - Extreme hazards
  - Min-maxing required
  - Player-created challenges
```

#### Economy Balance
```
Resource Abundance:
  Tier 1 (Wood, Stone, Fiber): Common - 70% spawn
  Tier 2 (Metal, Hide): Uncommon - 30% spawn
  Tier 3 (Crystal, Rare): Rare - 5% spawn

Crafting Costs:
  Basic tools: Affordable (3-6 materials)
  Structures: Significant (15-30 materials)
  Advanced items: Expensive (20-50 materials)
  Endgame: Very expensive (50-100+ materials)

Gathering Rates (per minute):
  Manual: 5-10 resources
  With tools: 15-25 resources
  With companions: 30-50 resources
  Optimal setup: 60-100 resources
```
