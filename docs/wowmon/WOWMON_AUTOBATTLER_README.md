## ü§î FAQ

### Q: How is this different from the original WoWmon?
**A:** Original is an active Pokemon-style adventure. This is a strategic idle game where battles happen automatically and you focus on team optimization.

### Q: Will players who liked the original enjoy this?
**A:** Different audience. Original = active players with time. This = busy players who want strategy without grinding.

### Q: How long until first prestige?
**A:** 3-4 weeks of casual play (5-10 min/day). Faster if more engaged (1-2 weeks).

### Q: Is this monetizable?
**A:** Designed as free/portfolio piece, but could add ethical cosmetics if needed. No pay-to-win.

### Q: What if players don't check in for weeks?
**A:** Capped at 8-48 hours (depending on upgrades). Long absence = max cap rewards. Not punished, not exponential.

### Q: How deep is the strategy?
**A:** 75+ creatures, 6+ synergies, type matchups, role compositions. Multiple viable strategies. Theory-crafting encouraged.
