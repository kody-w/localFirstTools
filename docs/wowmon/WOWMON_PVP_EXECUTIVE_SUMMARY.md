### 2. Battle System (Competitive Mechanics)

**Purpose**: Provide deep, skill-based battle mechanics with competitive balance.

**Advanced Damage Formula**:
```
Base = ((2×Lvl/5+2) × Power × Attack / Defense / 50) + 2
Final = Base × Weather × Crit × Random × STAB × Type × Items × Abilities × Screens
```

**Key Mechanics**:
- **STAB**: 1.5× damage for same-type moves
- **Type Effectiveness**: 0×, 0.5×, 1×, 2× multipliers
- **Critical Hits**: 12.5% base chance, 1.5× damage
- **Weather**: Sun boosts Fire, Rain boosts Water
- **Status Conditions**: Burn (halves Attack), Paralysis (halves Speed), Toxic (increasing damage)
- **Entry Hazards**: Stealth Rock (type-based), Spikes (layered), Toxic Spikes
- **Screens**: Reflect/Light Screen halve damage

**Competitive Depth**:
- Prediction-based gameplay (anticipate switches)
- Speed control (who moves first matters)
- Momentum management (maintaining offensive pressure)
- Hazard control (setting and removing hazards)
- Status spreading (crippling opponent's team)

### 3. Ranking & Matchmaking

**Purpose**: Fair skill-based matchmaking with accurate rating systems.

**ELO Rating Tiers**:
| Rank | Min ELO | % of Players | Icon |
|------|---------|--------------|------|

**Matchmaking Algorithm**:
1. Initial search: ±200 ELO difference
2. Expansion: +50 ELO every 30 seconds
3. Max wait: 5 minutes
4. Prioritize: Low latency > Same region > Similar wait time

**Anti-Smurf System**:
- Detect: High win rate + new account + advanced strategies
- Action: Boost hidden MMR, increase K-factor, match vs higher opponents
- Result: Fast climb to true skill level

### 4. Tournament System

**Purpose**: Organized competitive events with automated management.

**Tournament Formats**:
- **Single Elimination**: Lose once = out (fastest)
- **Double Elimination**: Winners + losers brackets (fairest)
- **Swiss System**: Round-robin, no elimination (most matches)
- **Round Robin**: Everyone plays everyone (small groups)
- **Battle Royale**: 100 players, last team standing (fun mode)

**Clauses & Rules**:
- ✓ Species Clause (no duplicate creatures)
- ✓ Sleep Clause (can't put 2+ opponent creatures to sleep)
- ✓ OHKO Clause (one-hit KO moves banned)

### 5. Replay & Analysis System

**Purpose**: Learn from battles through detailed post-game analysis.

**Replay Features**:
- Save every battle with turn-by-turn data
- Compressed storage using delta encoding
- Playback controls (speed, pause, seek)
- Share via URL, QR code, embed code
- Export to JSON, video (MP4), GIF

**Analysis Tools**:
- **Critical Moments**: Auto-highlight game-changing turns
- **Mistake Identification**: Suboptimal plays with suggestions
- **Performance Stats**: Damage dealt/taken, switches, predictions
- **MVP Calculation**: Score based on damage, KOs, survival
- **Momentum Chart**: Visual representation of who was winning each turn

**Example Analysis**:
```
Turn 5: CRITICAL MOMENT ⚡
→ Player1's Dire Wolf used Crunch on Murloc King
→ CRITICAL HIT! (178 damage)
→ Murloc King fainted!
→ This was the turning point of the battle.

Mistake Detected ⚠
→ Turn 3: Player2 should have switched to Ancient Wisp
→ Would have taken 0.5× damage instead of 2×
→ Cost: 85 HP (potentially changed outcome)
```

### 6. Anti-Cheat & Fair Play

**Purpose**: Maintain competitive integrity through comprehensive validation.

**Detection Methods**:
1. **Server-Side Validation**: Recalculate all damage, moves, stats
2. **Timing Analysis**: Detect instant decisions (bot-like behavior)
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Perfect predictions, automated inputs
4. **Packet Inspection**: Real-time action verification
5. **Replay Validation**: Reconstruct battle from seed

**Violations & Actions**:
| Severity | Examples | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Critical | Damage manipulation, impossible moves | Immediate ban |
| High | Perfect predictions (>90%), packet manipulation | Temp ban + review |
| Medium | Suspicious timing, rapid inputs | Warning + monitoring |

**Fair Play Score**:
- Base: 100 points
- Deductions: Warnings (-5), bans (-15), forfeits (-20), toxic chat (-10)
- Bonuses: Sportsmanship (+5), valid cheat reports (+2)
- **Score < 40**: Restricted from ranked play

## Competitive Balance Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **No Unviable Creatures** - Even low-tier creatures have niche uses
2. **Counterplay Always Exists** - No unbeatable strategies
3. **Skill > Team Composition** - Prediction matters more than stats
4. **Diversity Encouraged** - Multiple viable team archetypes
5. **Regular Balance Patches** - Monthly meta adjustments

### Balance Recommendations

**Nerfs Needed**:
- **Dragon**: BST too high (400+) → Reduce by 10-15%
- **Infernal**: Explosion (250 power) → Reduce to 200, user faints
- **Phoenix**: Speed 100 too fast → Reduce to 90

**Buffs Needed**:
- **Murloc**: Base HP 45 → 50 (too weak early)
- **Skeleton**: Add evolution or +10% stats (no evolution path)
- **Kobold**: Base Attack 35 → 45 (very limited use)

**Move Balance**:
- **Hyper Beam**: Add recharge turn (too strong)
- **Explosion**: User faints (appropriate drawback)
- **Quick Attack**: Fine as-is (balanced priority move)
