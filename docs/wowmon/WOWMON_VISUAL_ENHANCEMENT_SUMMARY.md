## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Add Core Engine

Copy the `BattleAnimationEngine` class from `WOWMON_ANIMATION_CODE_EXAMPLES.js` into your Game class section.

### 2. Initialize in Constructor

```javascript
constructor() {
    // ... existing code ...
    this.animEngine = new BattleAnimationEngine(this);
}
```

### 3. Update Game Loop

```javascript
update() {
    // ... existing code ...
    if (this.animEngine) {
        this.animEngine.update(16); // ~60fps
    }
}

render() {
    // ... existing rendering ...
    if (this.animEngine) {
        this.animEngine.render();
    }
}
```

### 4. Add Move Animations

```javascript
// Copy animation functions from examples
animateTackle(attacker, defender) { /* ... */ }
animateEmber(attacker, defender) { /* ... */ }
// ... etc
```

### 5. Integrate with Battle System

```javascript
async executeMove(attacker, defender, moveId, isPlayer) {
    const move = this.cartridge.moves[moveId];

    // Play animation
    const animName = `animate${this.toPascalCase(moveId)}`;
    if (typeof this[animName] === 'function') {
        await this[animName].call(this, attacker, defender);
    }

    // ... damage calculation ...
}
```

### 6. Test!

Start a battle and watch the magic happen!
