## Key Design Principles

### 1. Skill Over Stats
- Player skill determines success more than character level
- Skilled players can beat high-level content at low levels
- Perfect execution > grinding

### 2. Fair but Challenging
- All attacks are telegraphed
- Consistent rules for player and enemies
- Death teaches lessons
- Always a way to win with skill

### 3. Meaningful Choices
- Build diversity (STR, DEX, INT, FAI)
- Risk/reward in combat (stamina management)
- World exploration (shortcuts vs efficiency)
- Death consequences (soul recovery decisions)

### 4. Memorable Moments
- Boss victories feel earned
- Perfect parries are satisfying
- Clutch soul recoveries create stories
- Discovery of secrets is rewarding

---

## Core Mechanics Summary

### Combat System
- **Real-time action** with frame-perfect timing
- **Stamina management**: Every action costs stamina
- **I-frames**: 200ms invincibility on dodge
- **Parry/Riposte**: 150ms perfect timing for 3x damage
- **Lock-on targeting**: Z-targeting like Souls games
- **Combo system**: Chain attacks with rhythm

### Boss Design
- **Telegraph system**: Yellow → Orange → Red warnings
- **Learnable patterns**: AI selects attacks based on context
- **Phase transitions**: 2-3 phases with new attacks
- **Poise system**: Break poise for 3-sec vulnerability
- **Fair challenge**: Always recovery windows to heal

### Death & Progression
- **Soul loss**: Drop 50% EXP, 30% Gold on death
- **Blood stain**: ONE chance to recover souls
- **Bonfire system**: Checkpoints, healing, respawning
- **Stat allocation**: Soft/hard caps, build diversity
- **Weapon scaling**: S > A > B > C > D > E grades

### World Design
- **Interconnected**: Metroidvania-style connections
- **Shortcuts**: More valuable than fast travel
- **Exploration**: Hidden paths, secrets, optional areas
- **Progression**: Areas unlock with abilities/items
